# New Zealand Politician Tracker
 A website that tracks what New Zealand politicians do.

Eventually this application will be hosted at cjs.nz/nzpt, unless I can be bolthered registering a domain.

## What's here
This tool scrapes data from news sources once per day, currently Stuff.co.nz, RNZ.co.nz, and Beehive.govt.nz
It then searches each of these articles for the politicians being tracked by the site, and generates a blurb, tags, and link and puts all this information in a document for manual review and upload.
